### Installing mop from source

Ensure GO language is installed. Download from: http://goo-gl.me/JOs8v and the $GOPATH is set then:

```
git clone https://github.com/mop-tracker/mop
cd mop
go build ./cmd/mop
./mop
```

### Using mop
For demonstration purposes Mop comes preconfigured with a number of stock tickers. You can easily change the default list by using the following keyboard commands:

    +       Add stocks to the list.
    -       Remove stocks from the list.
    o       Change column sort order.
    g       Group stocks by advancing/declining issues.
    f       Set a filtering expression.
    F       Unset a filtering expression.
    PgDn    Scroll Down, down arrow key also works.
    PgUp    Scroll up, up arrow key also works.
    ?       Display help screen.
    esc     Quit mop.

When prompted please enter comma-delimited list of stock tickers. The list and other settings are stored in the profile file (default: ``.moprc`` in your ``$HOME`` directory)

### Expression-based Filtering
Mop has an in realtime expression-based filtering engine that is very easy to use.

At the main screen, press `f` and a prompt will appear. Write an expression that uses the stock properties.

Example:

```last <= 5```

This expression will make Mop show only the stocks whose `last` values are less than $5.

The available properties are: `last`, `change`, `changePercent`, `open`, `low`, `high`, `low52`, `high52`, `volume`, `avgVolume`, `pe`, `peX`, `dividend`, `yield`, `mktCap`, `mktCapX` and `advancing`.

The expression **must** return a boolean value, otherwise it will fail.

For detailed information about the syntax, please refer to [Knetic/govaluate#what-operators-and-types-does-this-support](https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate#what-operators-and-types-does-this-support).

To clear the filter, press `Shift+F`.

You can specify the profile you want to use by passing ``-profile <filename>`` to the command-line.
